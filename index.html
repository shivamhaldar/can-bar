            <p>A programming language is instructions wrote by developers/programmers that a computer will understand to do what a computer user or programmer wants it to do. 
                Programming is also known to some users as a computer language. The computer languages that programmers use is to be able develop application, scripts, 
                or other set instructions for a computer to execute certain information within applications. Currently within the programming language there are 
                a variety of different languages which are listed with in a database explaining which languages there are and what each language can do. 
                A computer programming is to tell a computer what to do through instructions which are then understood by the computer to perform these tasks.  
                A computer will then go through a series of steps to achieve these instructions. Essentially it is a process by any of these programs to design and implement a web browser. 
                There are many advantages of learning a computer programming as a programme will be able to gain new skills, be able to tell the computer what to do, and become better more familiar with computers. However,
                 computer programs can be challenging but rewarding at the same time when a programmer gets there computer program to work on a web browser.
